                    <h2>Trusts & Estates Planning</h2>
                    <p>
                        Planning for the future isn't just about protecting your assets—it's about protecting your 
                        family. A well-crafted estate plan ensures your wishes are honored and your loved ones are 
                        taken care of, even when you're no longer here to guide them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I work with families to create comprehensive estate plans that include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wills</strong> - Clearly document your wishes for asset distribution</li>
                        <li><strong>Trusts</strong> - Protect assets and provide for beneficiaries according to your specific goals</li>
                        <li><strong>Power of Attorney</strong> - Designate someone to handle your affairs if you're unable</li>
                        <li><strong>Healthcare Directives</strong> - Ensure your medical wishes are respected</li>
                        <li><strong>Estate Tax Planning</strong> - Minimize tax burdens for your heirs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Every family is different, and your estate plan should reflect that. I take the time to 
                        understand your unique situation and goals, then create a plan that works for you—no 
                        cookie-cutter solutions, no unnecessary complexity.

                    <h2>Probates & Trust Administration</h2>
                    <p>
                        Losing a loved one is difficult enough without having to navigate the legal complexities of 
                        probate or trust administration. During this challenging time, you need compassionate guidance 
                        and clear communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I help families through the probate and trust administration process, handling:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Probate Administration</strong> - Guide executors through the court-supervised process of settling an estate</li>
                        <li><strong>Trust Administration</strong> - Assist trustees in fulfilling their duties and distributing trust assets</li>
                        <li><strong>Estate Litigation</strong> - Resolve disputes that may arise during probate or administration</li>
                        <li><strong>Asset Distribution</strong> - Ensure assets are distributed according to the will or trust terms</li>
                        <li><strong>Creditor Claims</strong> - Handle creditor notifications and claims properly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to make this process as smooth and stress-free as possible for you and your 
                        family. I'll handle the legal details so you can focus on what matters most—honoring your 
                        loved one's memory and supporting each other.

                        clear communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I provide legal guidance for a wide range of real property matters:
